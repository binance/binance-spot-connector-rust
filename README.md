Official collection of auto-generated Rust SDK modules for Binance APIs.

## Migration Guide

If you're upgrading from the previous connector, refer to our [Migration Guide](./MIGRATION.md) for detailed steps on transitioning to the new modular structure. The legacy connector will still be available for a limited time. You can find the code for the old connector in the `legacy` branch.

## Prerequisites

Before using the connector, ensure you have:

* **Rust** (version 1.86.0 or later)
* **cargo** (comes with Rust)

Install or update Rust via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash
rustup install 1.86.0
rustup default 1.86.0
```

## Available Modules

All connectors are bundled within the single `binance-sdk` crate. Enable only the modules you need by specifying feature flags. Available features are:

* [`algo`](./src/algo) – Algo Trading connector

## Installation

Add `binance-sdk` to your `Cargo.toml`, enabling only the features you need. For example, to include `Spot` and `USDS-M Futures` modules:

```toml
[dependencies]
binance-sdk = { version = "68.1.1", features = ["derivatives_trading_usds_futures", "spot"] }
```

If you require all available connectors:

```toml
[dependencies]
binance-sdk = { version = "68.1.1", features = ["all"] }
```

## TLS Backend Selection

This library supports both **OpenSSL** (default) and **Rustls** backends.

**Default (OpenSSL):** Standard installation uses OpenSSL. This requires OpenSSL development headers to be installed on your system.

```toml
[dependencies]
binance-sdk = { version = "68.1.1", features = ["spot"] }
```

**Using Rustls (Pure Rust):** To use rustls (useful for cross-compilation or avoiding C-dependencies), you must disable default features and enable rustls-tls.

Note: Private key signing features currently require the openssl-tls feature.

```toml
[dependencies]
binance-sdk = { version = "68.1.1", default-features = false, features = ["rustls-tls", "spot"] }
```
